# Boom-Quiz-Project

This is a simple quiz app that was given to me as a task
in order to test my **front-end** skills. The project got me 
out of my comfort zone, with the requirment of using Next.js, and Im
very happy for that.

So the assignment was to develop a good-looking quiz interface that is able, supporting non-coding and coding questions with no more than 4 possible choices. The user 
should be able to answer a question and seamlessly go to the next question with a slide-up animation. A red progress bar should indicate the 
time left for a single question. If the user isnâ€™t able to answer a question on time, the quiz should proceed with the next question.

##Technology stack
* Javascript, React and Next.js
* CSS and SAASS

##The requirements and bonuses that I did
* The code for the web application should be managed in a version control system, more specifically Git.
* The user interface must most closely resemble the preview, given in this document.
* The web application should be created with Next.js.
* If the question contains a code snippet, the code should be highlighted.
* The progress bar should be moving for each question as time passes.
* The transition between questions should be made with a slide-up animation.
* The quiz must have an end screen of your preference. Make it look great.
* The user should be indicated when he does certain actions - hover a choice, click and hold a choice, etc.
* The questions and choices are fetched from an API that you have created
* The styles are done in SASS instead of CSS.
* Use Framer Motion for the animations
